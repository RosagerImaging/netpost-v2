# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status
Ready

## GitHub Tracking
**Issue #1**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/1

## Story
**As a** developer starting the NetPost V2 AI-Native Reselling Assistant,
**I want** a complete foundational project structure with Turborepo monorepo, Next.js web app, and all core configurations,
**so that** I can begin building the beta platform features on a solid, scalable technical foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Turborepo monorepo structure is established with proper apps and packages organization
2. Next.js web application is created in `apps/web` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configured
3. Shared UI component library package is set up in `packages/ui` with Shadcn/ui foundation
4. Shared configuration package is created in `packages/config` for Tailwind and TypeScript configs
5. Shared types package is established in `packages/shared-types` for cross-platform type definitions
6. Package.json scripts are configured for development, build, and test workflows across the monorepo
7. Development environment runs successfully with `npm run dev` serving the web app
8. Basic project documentation is in place (README.md with setup instructions)
9. ESLint and Prettier are configured for consistent code formatting across all packages
10. Git configuration includes proper .gitignore for monorepo and Next.js artifacts

## Dev Notes

### Project Context
This is the foundational story for Epic 1: Beta Platform & Core Workflow. All subsequent stories (1.2-1.9) will build on this technical foundation to create the complete AI-Native Reselling Assistant platform.

### Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Platform**: Vercel for frontend and serverless functions, Supabase for database/auth
- **Repository Structure**: Turborepo monorepo with apps/ and packages/ organization
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with Jamstack architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui as foundation for accessible, consistent UI components

### Design System Foundation
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- **Color Palette**: Primary #00BFFF (DeepSkyBlue), Accent #FFD700 (Gold), dark theme backgrounds
- **Typography**: Inter font family with deliberate sizing scale
- **Layout**: 8-point grid system for consistent spacing
- **Components**: Button, Input, Card as foundational components with Primary/Secondary/Destructive variants
- **Style**: Clean, modern, minimalist with glassmorphism effects

### Technical Stack Components
[Source: docs/brief.md, docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React components
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui for accessible component primitives
- **Development**: Turborepo for monorepo management, ESLint/Prettier for code quality
- **Deployment**: Vercel platform for optimal Next.js hosting

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Standards
- **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e testing
- **Test Location**: Tests colocated with components in packages/ui, app-level tests in apps/web/__tests__
- **Coverage**: Core components and utilities must have unit tests
- **E2E Testing**: Basic app functionality and routing tests
