## GitHub Tracking

**Issue #3**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/3

## Story

**As a** developer building the NetPost V2 platform,
**I want** a complete PostgreSQL database schema with core data models and Supabase configuration,
**so that** the application can store and manage users, inventory items, listings, and marketplace connections with proper relationships and performance optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Supabase PostgreSQL database is configured and accessible from the application
2. User profiles table extends Supabase Auth with additional reseller-specific fields
3. InventoryItem table supports complete item data including photos, descriptions, and sourcing information
4. Listing table manages cross-platform listing states and marketplace-specific data
5. MarketplaceConnection table handles user authentication tokens for marketplace APIs
6. Database relationships are properly defined with foreign keys and referential integrity
7. Performance indexes are created for common query patterns (user lookups, item searches)
8. Database migration system is established for schema version control
9. TypeScript types are generated from database schema for type safety
10. Database access patterns follow repository pattern for clean separation of concerns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Story 1.1 established the project foundation and Story 1.2 added Supabase Auth. This story extends the Supabase integration to include the complete database schema needed for the reselling platform.

### Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md, docs/architecture/9-database-schema.md]

- **Database Platform**: Supabase Managed PostgreSQL in US region
- **Data Models**: User, InventoryItem, Listing, MarketplaceConnection as core entities
- **Repository Pattern**: Backend uses repository pattern for database abstraction
- **Performance**: Real-time data synchronization requirements
- **Integration**: API reads/writes to database, supports both web and mobile apps

### Core Data Models

[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]

- **User**: Extends Supabase Auth with reseller profile data
- **InventoryItem**: Core inventory management with photos, descriptions, sourcing info
- **Listing**: Cross-platform listing management with marketplace-specific data
- **MarketplaceConnection**: Secure storage of marketplace API credentials and preferences

### Business Requirements Context

[Source: docs/brief.md, docs/prd/2-requirements.md]

- **Multi-Platform**: Support for 3-5 marketplaces (eBay, Poshmark, etc.)
- **Real-Time Sync**: Data synchronization between web and mobile apps
- **Professional Users**: Large inventory management for professional resellers
- **Performance**: Application must feel fast with efficient data access
- **Security**: Secure storage of marketplace credentials and user data

### Database Schema Patterns

```sql
-- Core Tables
user_profiles (extends auth.users)
inventory_items (user_id, title, description, photos[], status, sourcing_data)
listings (inventory_item_id, marketplace_id, external_id, status, pricing)
marketplace_connections (user_id, marketplace_type, credentials_encrypted, status)

-- Key Relationships
user_profiles.id -> inventory_items.user_id
inventory_items.id -> listings.inventory_item_id
user_profiles.id -> marketplace_connections.user_id
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md]

- **Real-time synchronization**: Fast data access for mobile and web
- **Search capability**: Full-text search across inventory items
- **Scalability**: Support for professional users with large inventories
- **Query optimization**: Efficient lookups for dashboard and listing views

### Security & Compliance

[Source: docs/architecture/13-security-and-performance.md]

- **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security for multi-tenant data isolation
- **Credential Encryption**: Secure storage of marketplace API tokens
- **Data Privacy**: User data protection and GDPR compliance considerations
- **Audit Trail**: Change tracking for important business data
