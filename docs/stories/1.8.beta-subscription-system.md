# Story 1.8: Beta Subscription System

## Status

Ready

## GitHub Tracking

**Issue #14**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/14

## Story

**As a** beta program administrator and future paying user,
**I want** a functional subscription management system with beta testing capabilities,
**so that** beta users can access the platform with proper usage tracking while preparing for paid subscription tiers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Beta subscription system allows unlimited access for approved beta testers
2. Subscription tiers are defined (Free Trial, Hobbyist, Pro) with feature restrictions
3. User subscription status is tracked and enforced across the application
4. Billing integration is implemented in test mode (Stripe test environment)
5. Usage metrics are collected for beta users (listings created, items managed, API calls)
6. Admin dashboard shows subscription status and usage analytics for all users
7. Beta users can view their current subscription status and usage statistics
8. System handles subscription transitions (beta to paid, trial to paid, upgrades/downgrades)
9. Feature gating enforces subscription limits on core functionality
10. Email notifications handle subscription events (welcome, usage warnings, billing issues)

### Stripe Integration Requirements

- **Test Environment**: All billing in Stripe test mode during beta
- **Webhook Security**: Proper signature verification for Stripe events
- **Subscription Events**: Handle creation, updates, cancellations, payment failures
- **Customer Portal**: Stripe customer portal for self-service billing management

### Usage Metrics to Track

- **Inventory Management**: Items added, photos uploaded, storage used
- **Listing Activity**: Listings created, marketplaces connected, API calls
- **User Engagement**: Login frequency, feature usage, support requests
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, system health

### Testing Standards
