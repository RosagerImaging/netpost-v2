# Story 1.7: Automated De-Listing System

## Status

Ready

## GitHub Tracking

**Issue #11**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/11

## Story

**As a** reseller who sells items across multiple marketplaces,
**I want** an automated system that removes sold items from all other marketplaces,
**so that** I can avoid overselling and maintain professional seller reputation without manual cleanup effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System detects when an item is sold on any marketplace through webhook or polling
2. Automated de-listing removes item from all other active marketplaces simultaneously
3. Users can configure de-listing preferences (immediate, delayed, or manual confirmation)
4. De-listing process handles marketplace-specific requirements and API calls
5. Failed de-listing attempts are logged and retried with exponential backoff
6. Users receive notifications about successful and failed de-listing activities
7. Manual de-listing option allows users to remove items on-demand
8. Audit trail tracks all de-listing activities with timestamps and reasons
9. System handles partial de-listing scenarios (some marketplaces succeed, others fail)
10. De-listing dashboard shows recent activity and allows bulk management actions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Stories 1.1-1.6 established project foundation, authentication, database schema, mobile sourcing, web inventory management, and cross-listing functionality. This story completes the core listing lifecycle with automated de-listing.

### Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md, docs/architecture/7-external-apis.md]

- **Sale Detection**: Webhook receivers and polling mechanisms
- **De-Listing APIs**: Marketplace-specific removal API calls
- **Job Processing**: Async job queue for concurrent de-listing operations
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notification delivery

### Core De-Listing Workflow

[Source: docs/brief.md - Semi-Automated De-Listing section]

- **Primary Function**: Reliable auto-delisting feature for top 3-5 marketplaces
- **Key Features**: Automated sale detection, parallel de-listing, error recovery
- **User Experience**: Set-and-forget automation with manual override options
- **Performance**: Fast response to sales with minimal user intervention

### Marketplace Integration Requirements

**eBay Integration:**
- Trading API for listing management and ending auctions
- Webhook notifications for sold items
- Handle different sale types (Buy It Now, auction end)

**Poshmark Integration:**
- REST API for listing management
- Webhook or polling for sale notifications
- Handle Poshmark-specific selling workflows

**Facebook Marketplace Integration:**
- Graph API for listing management
- Sale detection through messaging or status updates
- Local marketplace specific considerations

### Data Model Integration

[Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md, Story 1.3 context]

**Enhanced Listing Model:**
```sql
listings (
  id, inventory_item_id, user_id,
  marketplace_type, marketplace_listing_id,
  status, -- active, sold, delisted, failed
  delisting_job_id, delisted_at,
  sale_detected_at, sale_marketplace
)

delisting_jobs (
  id, inventory_item_id, user_id,
  trigger_type, -- auto, manual
  status, -- pending, processing, completed, failed
  marketplaces_targeted, marketplaces_completed,
  error_log, retry_count, created_at, completed_at
)

user_delisting_preferences (
  id, user_id,
  auto_delist_enabled, delay_minutes,
  notification_email, notification_app,
  require_confirmation
)
```

### Webhook and Event Processing

[Source: docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification and payload validation
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate processing of sale events
- **Failure Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed webhook processing
- **Polling Fallback**: Backup mechanism for unreliable webhook delivery

### Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md]

- **Fast Response**: Quick de-listing after sale detection
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handle multiple de-listing jobs simultaneously
- **Reliable Delivery**: Ensure de-listing completes even with API failures
- **User Feedback**: Real-time status updates during de-listing process

### Security Considerations

- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification and IP whitelisting
- **API Security**: Secure handling of marketplace credentials
- **Audit Security**: Secure logging without exposing sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect marketplace API limits and avoid blocks

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Individual components and de-listing logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end de-listing flows with marketplace sandboxes
- **Webhook Tests**: Webhook processing and error scenarios
- **Load Tests**: High-volume de-listing performance testing
- **Security Tests**: Webhook security and credential handling
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/src/lib/delisting/**/*.test.ts`

### Error Handling Categories

- **Sale Detection Errors**: Invalid webhooks, parsing failures
- **API Errors**: Marketplace unavailable, authentication failures
- **Network Errors**: Timeout, connection issues
- **Business Logic Errors**: Already delisted, insufficient permissions

### Notification Templates

- **Successful De-listing**: "Item sold on [Marketplace]! Automatically removed from X other marketplaces."
- **Partial Failure**: "Item delisted from X/Y marketplaces. Some failed - check dashboard."
- **Complete Failure**: "Unable to delist item from any marketplace. Manual action required."
- **Configuration**: "De-listing preferences updated successfully."
