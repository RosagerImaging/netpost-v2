# Story 1.4: Mobile Sourcing App Setup

## Status

Ready

## GitHub Tracking

**Issue #8**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/8

## Story

**As a** reseller who sources items in the field,
**I want** a mobile React Native app with basic sourcing capabilities,
**so that** I can capture inventory items on-the-go and sync them with the main web application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React Native mobile app is initialized and configured in the monorepo
2. App connects to Supabase for authentication and data synchronization
3. Basic navigation structure is implemented with sourcing workflow screens
4. Camera functionality allows users to capture photos of potential inventory items
5. Basic item capture form includes title, description, and sourcing location
6. Items captured on mobile sync in real-time with the web application database
7. App works on both iOS and Android development environments
8. TypeScript integration provides type safety across mobile and web apps
9. Authentication flow allows users to login with same credentials as web app
10. App follows project coding standards and architecture patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Stories 1.1-1.3 established the project foundation, user authentication, and database schema. This story extends the platform to mobile by creating the companion sourcing app mentioned in the project brief.

### Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md, docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

- **Mobile Platform**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- **Integration**: Monorepo structure with shared types and components
- **Real-time Sync**: Supabase client for authentication and data synchronization
- **Target Platforms**: iOS and Android development environments

### Core Mobile Workflow

[Source: docs/brief.md - Mobile Sourcing App section]

- **Primary Function**: Simplified companion mobile app focused on in-field sourcing
- **Key Features**: Photo capture, basic item information entry, real-time sync
- **User Experience**: Seamless workflow from mobile sourcing to web management
- **Integration**: Must sync with web app database and user accounts

### Technical Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md - Technical Considerations]

- **Frontend**: React Native for mobile development
- **Authentication**: Third-party service (Supabase Auth) for user management
- **Real-time Sync**: Data synchronization mechanism between mobile and web
- **Performance**: Application must feel fast with responsive interactions

```

### Shared Package Integration

- **shared-types**: Database types and API interfaces shared with web app
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth configuration shared across platforms
- **UI Components**: Potential shared component library for common elements

### Testing Standards

- **Unit Tests**: React Native Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and navigation flow testing
- **E2E Tests**: Detox for end-to-end mobile testing (future story)
- **Test Location**: `apps/mobile/__tests__/` and `apps/mobile/src/**/*.test.ts`

### Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md]

- **Real-time synchronization**: Fast data sync between mobile and web
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth navigation and form interactions
- **Photo handling**: Efficient camera integration and image processing
- **Offline support**: Basic offline capability with sync queue

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Secure token storage using device secure storage
- **API Communication**: HTTPS only for all API calls
- **Photo Storage**: Secure photo upload to Supabase storage
- **User Data**: Row Level Security policies for multi-tenant data
