## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Stories 1.1-1.3 established the project foundation, user authentication, and database schema. This story extends the platform to mobile by creating the companion sourcing app mentioned in the project brief.

### Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md, docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md]

- **Mobile Platform**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- **Integration**: Monorepo structure with shared types and components
- **Real-time Sync**: Supabase client for authentication and data synchronization
- **Target Platforms**: iOS and Android development environments

### Core Mobile Workflow

[Source: docs/brief.md - Mobile Sourcing App section]

- **Primary Function**: Simplified companion mobile app focused on in-field sourcing
- **Key Features**: Photo capture, basic item information entry, real-time sync
- **User Experience**: Seamless workflow from mobile sourcing to web management
- **Integration**: Must sync with web app database and user accounts

### Technical Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md - Technical Considerations]

- **Frontend**: React Native for mobile development
- **Authentication**: Third-party service (Supabase Auth) for user management
- **Real-time Sync**: Data synchronization mechanism between mobile and web
- **Performance**: Application must feel fast with responsive interactions

```

### Shared Package Integration

- **shared-types**: Database types and API interfaces shared with web app
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth configuration shared across platforms
- **UI Components**: Potential shared component library for common elements

### Testing Standards

- **Integration Tests**: API integration and navigation flow testing
- **E2E Tests**: Detox for end-to-end mobile testing (future story)
- **Test Location**: `apps/mobile/__tests__/` and `apps/mobile/src/**/*.test.ts`

### Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/brief.md]

- **Real-time synchronization**: Fast data sync between mobile and web
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth navigation and form interactions
- **Photo handling**: Efficient camera integration and image processing
- **Offline support**: Basic offline capability with sync queue

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Secure token storage using device secure storage
- **API Communication**: HTTPS only for all API calls
- **Photo Storage**: Secure photo upload to Supabase storage
