## Status

Done

## GitHub Tracking

**Issue #10**: https://github.com/RosagerImaging/netpost-v2/issues/10

## Story

**As a** reseller who wants to maximize item visibility,
**I want** to cross-list my inventory items to multiple marketplaces from a single interface,
**so that** I can reach more buyers and increase sales without manual duplication effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can select inventory items and choose target marketplaces for listing
2. Cross-listing form collects marketplace-specific information (pricing, shipping, categories)
3. System integrates with at least 3 major marketplace APIs (eBay, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace)
4. Marketplace connection setup allows users to authenticate with their marketplace accounts
5. Listings are created simultaneously across selected marketplaces
6. Each marketplace listing gets tracked with external IDs and status
7. Users can view listing status across all marketplaces from a unified dashboard
8. Failed listings show error messages and allow retry functionality
9. Listing variations (size, color, condition) are handled per marketplace requirements
10. All cross-listing activity is logged for audit and troubleshooting
