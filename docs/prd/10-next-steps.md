### UX Expert Prompt

The PRD for the AI-Native Reselling Assistant is complete. Please review the 'User Interface Design Goals' section (Section 3) and work with the user to create the detailed UI/UX Specification document (front-end-spec.md). Focus on creating the information architecture, user flows, and wireframes needed to guide the frontend architecture.

### Architect Prompt

The PRD for the AI-Native Reselling Assistant is complete and validated. Please use this document, along with the Project Brief, to create the detailed fullstack architecture. Pay close attention to the Technical Assumptions (Section 4), particularly the Python backend, React/React Native frontend, serverless architecture, and the monorepo structure.
