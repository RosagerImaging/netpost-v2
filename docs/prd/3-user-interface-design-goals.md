# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to provide a clean, fast, and intuitive interface that empowers resellers to manage their business with minimal friction. The design should prioritize clarity and speed, guiding the user through their most common workflows in the fewest steps possible.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-Click Actions:** Repetitive, high-frequency tasks should be achievable with a single, clear action.
- **Customizable AI Automation:** By default, AI features will act as on-demand assistants. However, a dedicated AI Settings area will allow power users to enable higher levels of automation.
- **Mobile-First Sourcing:** The mobile app experience will be optimized for the "in-the-field" sourcing workflow.

## Core Screens and Views

- Login / Sign-up Screen
- Main Dashboard
- Inventory View
- Item Detail / Listing Editor View
- Marketplace Integration Page
- AI Communication Assistant View
- Settings Page (including Account, Display, and AI Controls)

## Accessibility, Branding, and Target Platforms

- **Accessibility:** The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Branding:** The visual branding should be modern, clean, and trustworthy.
- **Target Device and Platforms:** The product will consist of a Responsive Web Application and native Mobile Applications for iOS and Android.
