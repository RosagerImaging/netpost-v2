### PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY

#### Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 98%

#### MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined, realistic for a solo founder, and strategically sound. The phased beta-to-launch plan effectively de-risks the project by separating the core platform development from the more complex AI feature development.

#### Technical Readiness

The technical assumptions are clear, modern, and provide an excellent set of constraints for the Architect. The chosen stack aligns perfectly with the project's "AI-Native" and "Cross-Platform" goals.

#### Recommendations

The PRD is in excellent condition. My only recommendation is to proceed directly to the next phase of the BMad workflow: Architecture.
