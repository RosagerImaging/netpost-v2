## 🚀 How to Use the Enhanced Workflow

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Write Code with TDD**
   ```bash
   # Write failing test first
   npm run test:watch

   # Write code to make test pass
   # Refactor while keeping tests green
   ```

3. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run full validation before pushing
   npm run validate:enhanced

   # Or skip security checks for speed during development
   npm run validate:enhanced:skip-security
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Create PR on GitHub
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Errors (Current Status)
The validation shows TypeScript errors in the web app. To fix:

```bash
# Run type check to see errors
npm run type-check

# Common fixes needed:
# - Fix query function return types in cross-listing components
# - Ensure error objects have consistent typing
# - Update component prop types to match usage
```

#### 2. Claude Integration Not Working
If `@claude` mentions don't trigger responses:

1. **Check Workflow Status**: Go to Actions tab on GitHub
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure repository has proper app permissions
3. **Check Secrets**: Verify `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is set in repository secrets
4. **Validate Config**: Ensure `.claude/github-integration.json` exists

#### 3. Coverage Threshold Failures
If coverage drops below 80%:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Add missing tests for uncovered code
# Focus on critical paths and edge cases
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Skip Validation (Use Sparingly)
```bash
# For urgent hotfixes only
npm run deploy:emergency
```

#### Disable Specific Checks
```bash
# Skip security validation temporarily
npm run validate:enhanced:skip-security
```
