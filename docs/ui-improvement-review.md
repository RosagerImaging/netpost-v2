# UI Improvement & Risk Report

## Suggested Improvements / Breakage Risks

- **Instrument data fetches** Replace analytics mock data with service-layer hooks per the guidelines in `docs/TYPESCRIPT-VALIDATION-PIPELINE.md`, include loading/error states, and prevent user confusion when data is unavailable.
- **Accessibility in navigation** Enhance the mobile sidebar in `apps/web/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx` with focus trapping, ESC key handling, and accurate `aria-hidden` toggling while the drawer is open.
- **Action feedback** Surface success and failure feedback for `onRetry`, `onCancel`, and `onConfirm` mutations in `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/delisting/components/DelistingJobsTable.tsx` using the design system's toast or alert components.
- **Spec compliance** Align navigation labels and top-level shell elements with `docs/front-end-spec.md` and `docs/UI-WIREFRAMES-AND-FLOWS.md`, adding the global search bar, sync status footer, and pending sections like AI Assist.
- **Responsive tuning** Revisit grid breakpoints in analytics and delisting views to ensure compliance with the documented responsive strategy, avoiding overflow in sections such as Platform Performance and filter toolbars.

## UI/UX Principles & Specific Implementations

- **Navigation menus** Apply clear wayfinding across the entire application shell: reinforce active states in `apps/web/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx`, mirror those cues in any auth-only layouts, and ensure mobile navigation (drawer + tab bars) for sourcing, inventory, analytics, AI Assist, and settings screens follows the same transition and iconography conventions documented in `docs/UI-WIREFRAMES-AND-FLOWS.md`.
- **Forms & inputs** Deliver real-time validation, inline errors, and predictive hints on every data-entry surface—from authentication and onboarding forms to inventory editors, manual delisting selectors, and marketplace connection wizards—using the patterns described in Flow 1 of `docs/UI-WIREFRAMES-AND-FLOWS.md` and the guidelines in `docs/front-end-spec.md`.
- **Calls to action (CTAs)** Standardize CTA hierarchy across all flows (dashboard quick actions, sourcing uploads, listing publication, delisting confirmations, analytics exports, AI Assist automations, mobile capture flows). Use action-oriented copy, consistent sizing, and primary/secondary variants defined in the design system to satisfy the playbook’s CTA pattern.
- **Feedback systems** Provide immediate, multimodal feedback for critical events throughout the product: authentication outcomes, inventory sync, AI recommendations, delisting job states, analytics refreshes, and mobile uploads. Combine toast banners, inline status pills, subtle motion, and optional haptics to close the loop per the article’s guidance.
- **Modals & dialogs** Audit modal usage in dashboard dialogs, manual delisting confirmation, AI recommendation previews, and mobile overlays to ensure they remain purposeful, include descriptive headlines/body copy, support ESC/overlay dismiss, and avoid stacking—aligned with the playbook’s dialog best practices.
- **Search & filtering** Extend robust, assisted search to every list view (inventory, listings, delisting jobs, analytics breakdowns, AI history). Incorporate autocomplete, recent queries, saved filters, and logical grouping so users can discover content efficiently, as recommended by the search/filtering pattern.
- **Progress indicators** Introduce transparent progress cues for long-running or multi-step flows: onboarding, sourcing → listing pipeline, bulk edits, manual delisting execution, data imports/exports, and AI automation sequences. Use descriptive step labels and smooth transitions to avoid “progress whiplash.”
- **Contextual help** Embed just-in-time tips near complex interactions across the suite—AI pricing suggestions, marketplace linking, analytics insights, delisting triggers, and form fields with high error rates. Make helpers dismissible and adaptive to user behavior, fulfilling the article’s contextual help technique.
- **Consistency & standards** Conduct a cross-screen audit (web + mobile) to keep typography, spacing, and component variants aligned with `docs/visual-development-complete-design-guidelines.md`, ensuring navigation, tables, cards, dialogs, and buttons behave predictably application-wide.
- **Accessibility** Continue the inclusive design mandate for every new component: verify color contrast, keyboard navigation, focus order, ARIA labeling, and reduced-motion support in auth, dashboard, inventory, analytics, AI, and mobile contexts, per the accessibility technique section.
- **Performance optimization** Apply the playbook’s performance advice globally—lazy-loadheavy charts, defer AI insight generation, optimize image delivery in inventory/listings, leverage CDN caching for assets, and monitor interaction latency to keep experiences responsive across devices.
- **User-centered design & testing** Operationalize continuous user research and usability testing across major flows (auth, sourcing, inventory management, delisting, analytics, AI). Feed findings into iterative prototypes before implementation, ensuring the entire product roadmap stays grounded in validated user needs.

## Implementation roadmap

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & Align (Weeks 1-2)

- **[navigation-accessibility]** Harden global navigation states, mobile drawer accessibility, and add the spec-mandated search/sync status elements (`dashboard-layout.tsx`).
- **[data-feedback]** Replace analytics mocks with service hooks and introduce consistent toast/alert feedback for delisting actions and system mutations.
- **[form-validation]** Implement real-time validation + inline errors on high-traffic forms (auth, manual delisting, inventory editors) per `docs/front-end-spec.md`.

### Phase 2 — Discoverability & Guidance (Weeks 3-4)

- **[search-filtering]** Roll out enhanced search/autocomplete and saved filters across inventory, listings, analytics drill-downs, and AI history tables.
- **[contextual-help]** Embed just-in-time helper tooltips or panels for AI pricing, marketplace linking, and other complex flows identified in usability tests.
- **[progress-indicators]** Add descriptive progress bars/steps for sourcing→listing, bulk operations, and long-running delisting jobs to eliminate progress gaps.

### Phase 3 — Performance & Iteration (Weeks 5-6)

- **[consistency-audit]** Conduct cross-platform UI audit against `docs/visual-development-complete-design-guidelines.md`, resolving spacing/typography/component drifts.
- **[performance-pass]** Optimize chart loading, image delivery, and AI insight generation; introduce monitoring to track INP/LCP targets mentioned in `docs/front-end-spec.md`.
- **[research-loop]** Schedule usability sessions covering AI Assist, analytics insights, and mobile capture to validate improvements and feed the next iteration cycle.
