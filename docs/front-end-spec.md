AI-Native Reselling Assistant UI/UX Specification

1. Introduction
   This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the AI-Native Reselling Assistant's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas:
Our design must serve two distinct groups identified in the PRD:

The Professional Reseller: An efficiency-focused expert who needs a powerful, fast, and scalable tool.

The Casual Reseller: A price-sensitive hobbyist who prioritizes simplicity and ease of use above all else.

Usability Goals:

Ease of Use: New or casual users should be able to list their first item with minimal guidance.

Efficiency: Professional users should be able to complete their most frequent, repetitive tasks in the fewest steps possible.

Clarity: The interface must be clean and unambiguous, presenting information clearly to reduce cognitive load.

Design Principles:

Clarity Above All: Prioritize simple, clear communication over clever or dense interfaces.

Efficiency for Experts: Design core workflows to be as fast as possible for power users.

Trustworthy AI: Introduce AI features as helpful assistants that keep the user in control, building trust through transparency and opt-in automation.

Seamless Sync: The experience between the web and mobile apps must feel like a single, cohesive application, with data always in sync.

Deliberate & Distinctive Design: Every design choice—from color and typography to spacing and motion—will be a deliberate decision aimed at creating a unique, memorable, and polished identity. We will actively avoid generic defaults to ensure the app stands out from the crowd.

        G --> G3[AI Controls]
    end

    A --> B

Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation: After logging in, the main navigation (e.g., a persistent sidebar) will provide direct access to the application's core sections: Dashboard, Inventory, AI Assistant, Marketplace Integrations, and Settings.

Secondary Navigation: Within complex sections like "Settings," a secondary navigation (e.g., tabs) will be used to switch between subsections.

Breadcrumb Strategy: Breadcrumbs will be used on deeply nested pages to provide clear context and easy one-click navigation back to parent pages.

3. User Flows
   Flow 1: Sourcing & Listing a New Item
   User Goal: To get an item from a physical location into their inventory and listed for sale on multiple marketplaces with minimal effort.

Entry Points: The "Add Item" button on the Mobile App.

Success Criteria: The item is successfully listed on the selected marketplaces, and the inventory status is correctly updated.

        M --> N{Click 'List Now'};
    end

    I --> K;
    N --> O[Item is Listed on Marketplaces];

Edge Cases & Error Handling:

SKU/Visual Search not found: The user will be prompted to enter the item details manually.

Mobile app is offline: The new item will be saved locally and sync automatically when a connection is re-established.

Marketplace API error: The system will indicate which listings succeeded and failed, with an option to retry.

4. Wireframes & Mockups
   Primary Design Files
   The primary source of truth for all high-fidelity visual designs, mockups, and interactive prototypes will be a shared Figma project.

Key Screen Layouts
Screen: Web App - Inventory List

Purpose: To provide a comprehensive overview of all sourced and listed items, allowing for quick status checks and actions.

Key Elements:

Header: Page title "Inventory" and a prominent "Add New Item" button.

Search & Filter Bar: Text search for titles and dropdown filters for status and marketplaces.

Item Display Area: A grid or list of items, each showing a photo, title, status badge, and price.

Quick Actions: A context menu ("...") on each item with options like "Edit", "List Now", and "Delete".

5. Component Library / Design System
   Design System Approach
   We will create a custom design system implemented using Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn/ui for core, accessible component primitives, supporting our "Deliberate & Distinctive Design" principle.

Core Components
Button: With Primary, Secondary, Destructive, and Link variants and all standard states (Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading).

Input Field: For all text and data entry, with all standard states (Default, Focused, Error, Disabled).

Card: A container for grouped information, with Default and Selectable variants.

6. Branding & Style Guide
   (This section is based on the "Visual Development Complete Design Guidelines" document provided.)

Visual Identity
The identity will be clean, modern, and minimalist, built upon a monochromatic, dark-themed aesthetic with generous use of negative space.

Color Palette
Primary: `oklch(0.7161 0.0091 56.2590)` (Teal) - For primary interactive elements.

Accent: `oklch(0.3755 0.0700 176.3952)` (Stone) - For secondary highlights.

Backgrounds: `oklch(0.1738 0.0026 67.6532)` (Background Dark), `oklch(0.2161 0.0061 56.0434)` (Card/Surface).

Text & Borders: Off-white and light grays.

Typography
Primary Font: Figtree.

Layout & Spacing
Grid System: A strict 8-point grid system.

Component Styling & Motion
Core Style: Key components will utilize a "Glassmorphism" effect.

Icons: Minimalist, line-art style.

Micro-interactions: Subtle, fluid, and responsive animations.

7. Accessibility Requirements
   The application will be designed and developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standard. This includes requirements for color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and touch target sizes.

8. Responsiveness Strategy
   The application will be designed mobile-first, using the standard Tailwind CSS breakpoints. Layouts will adapt from single-column on mobile to multi-column grids on larger screens, and navigation will collapse into a "hamburger" menu on smaller devices.

9. Animation & Micro-interactions
   Animation will be purposeful, fluid, and respectful of user preferences (prefers-reduced-motion). Key animations include subtle state transitions, modal entries, and the use of skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance.

10. Performance, Next Steps & Handoff
    Performance Considerations
    The application will target a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 2.5 seconds and an Interaction to Next Paint (INP) of under 200 milliseconds, aligning with Google's Core Web Vitals.

Next Steps
Immediate Actions:

Create a project in Figma and build out the custom design system (colors, typography).

Create high-fidelity mockups for the key screens.

Share the completed specification and mockups with the Architect and development team.
