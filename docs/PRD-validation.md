MVP Scope Assessment
The MVP scope is well-defined, realistic for a solo founder, and strategically sound. The phased beta-to-launch plan effectively de-risks the project by separating the core platform development from the more complex AI feature development.

Technical Readiness
The technical assumptions are clear, modern, and provide an excellent set of constraints for the Architect. The chosen stack aligns perfectly with the project's "AI-Native" and "Cross-Platform" goals.

Recommendations
The PRD is in excellent condition. My only recommendation is to proceed directly to the next phase of the BMad workflow: Architecture.

With the validation complete, I will now add the final section to the PRD, which provides the official handoff prompts for the next agents in the workflow.

Next Steps
UX Expert Prompt
The PRD for the AI-Native Reselling Assistant is complete. Please review the 'User Interface Design Goals' section (Section 3) and work with the user to create the detailed UI/UX Specification document (front-end-spec.md). Focus on creating the information architecture, user flows, and wireframes needed to guide the frontend architecture.

Architect Prompt
The PRD for the AI-Native Reselling Assistant is complete and validated. Please use this document, along with the Project Brief, to create the detailed fullstack architecture. Pay close attention to the Technical Assumptions (Section 4), particularly the Python backend, React/React Native frontend, serverless architecture, and the monorepo structure.
