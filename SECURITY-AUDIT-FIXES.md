## Critical Issues Fixed

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Webhook Secret Validation (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/webhooks/webhook-handler.ts`

**Problem:**
- All 14 marketplace webhook secrets used non-null assertion (`!`) without runtime validation
- Missing secrets would cause undefined values in production, bypassing security

**Solution:**
- Created `getWebhookSecret()` function with runtime validation
- Throws descriptive errors if secrets are missing
- Updated all webhook configs to use lazy validation

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Dangerous non-null assertion
secret: process.env.EBAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET!

// After: Safe runtime validation
secret: getWebhookSecret('ebay', 'EBAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
```

#### 2. Development Mode Security Bypass (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/webhooks/webhook-handler.ts`

**Problem:**
- `NODE_ENV=development` completely disabled webhook signature verification
- Security bypass could be accidentally deployed to production

**Solution:**
- Removed development mode bypass from main webhook handler
- Moved test functionality to separate `testWebhook()` function
- Added strict production environment check

**Impact:** Prevents accidental security bypass in production

#### 3. Missing Environment Variable Validation (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/config/env-validation.ts` (NEW)

**Problem:**
- No centralized validation of required environment variables
- Application could start with missing critical configuration

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive environment validation system
- Validates all required variables at startup
- Provides clear error messages with setup instructions
- Categorizes variables by type (database, auth, webhooks, etc.)

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { validateOrThrow } from '@/lib/config/env-validation';

// At application startup
validateOrThrow();
```

---

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH: Race Conditions & Concurrency

#### 4. Queue Processor Singleton Pattern (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/queues/sale-event-queue.ts`

**Problem:**
- No mechanism to prevent multiple instances of queue processor
- Multiple calls to `startQueueProcessor()` caused overlapping processors
- Led to duplicate processing and database conflicts

**Solution:**
- Implemented singleton pattern with state tracking
- Added `stopQueueProcessor()` for graceful shutdown
- Added `isQueueProcessorRunning()` status check

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added singleton state
let queueProcessorRunning = false;
let processingLoopTimeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;

// Check before starting
if (queueProcessorRunning) {
  console.warn('Queue processor already running');
  return;
}
```

#### 5. Concurrency Limits for Batch Operations (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/utils/concurrency.ts` (NEW)

**Problem:**
- Health checks ran for ALL connections simultaneously
- No concurrency limit on batch operations
- Could fire 100+ parallel API calls causing rate limiting

**Solution:**
- Created `batchExecute()` utility with concurrency control
- Updated health checks to use concurrency limit of 5
- Added progress tracking and error handling

**Impact:** Prevents API overload and rate limiting

#### 6. Exponential Backoff & Circuit Breaker (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/polling/sale-poller.ts`

**Problem:**
- Fixed 500ms delay between polls regardless of failures
- No exponential backoff on errors
- No circuit breaker pattern to prevent hammering failing APIs

**Solution:**
- Implemented circuit breaker with 3 states (closed, open, half-open)
- Added exponential backoff with retry logic
- Adaptive delays based on consecutive failures
- Circuit opens after 5 failures, resets after 1 minute

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Circuit breaker prevents hammering failed APIs
if (!canExecute(circuitKey)) {
  return { success: false, error: 'Circuit breaker open' };
}

// Exponential backoff on retries
const result = await retryWithBackoff(
  () => pollUserListings(userId, marketplace),
  { maxRetries: 3, initialDelayMs: 1000, backoffMultiplier: 2 }
);
```

### ðŸŸ  MEDIUM: Memory Leaks & Resource Management

#### 7. Real-Time Subscription Cleanup (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/lib/supabase-inventory.ts`

**Problem:**
- Real-time subscriptions were disabled with mock cleanup
- Mock `unsubscribe()` didn't actually clean up anything
- Potential memory leaks if components called this expecting real cleanup

**Solution:**
- Re-enabled real-time subscriptions with proper implementation
- Added proper channel cleanup using `supabase.removeChannel()`
- Fixed type assertions for payload handling

#### 8. Event Listener Cleanup (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/services/listing-job-queue.ts`

**Problem:**
- `setInterval` for auto-cleanup had no cleanup mechanism
- Interval would continue running even after component unmount

**Solution:**
- Store interval ID for cleanup
- Export `stopAutoCleanup()` function for graceful shutdown
- Added proper cleanup documentation

#### 9. Auth Context Error Handling (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`

**Problem:**
- `getInitialSession()` didn't handle errors
- Network failures left users stuck in loading state forever

**Solution:**
- Added try-catch with proper error handling
- Set loading to false even on errors
- Log errors for debugging without breaking UX

---

### ðŸ”µ MEDIUM: Type Safety & Code Quality

#### 10. ESLint Rules Upgraded (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs`

**Problem:**
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` set to "warn" instead of "error"
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` set to "warn" instead of "error"
- Allowed `any` types and unused variables to pass builds

**Solution:**
- Upgraded both rules to "error"
- Added ignore patterns for intentional unused vars (`^_`)
- Maintains strict type safety during development

#### 11. Type Assertion Fixes (FIXED)
**File:** `packages/ui/src/components/button.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Used `as any` to cast KeyboardEvent to MouseEvent
- Lost type safety

**Solution:**
- Changed to `as unknown as React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`
- More explicit about the type conversion
- Added comment explaining the compatibility

#### 12. Rate Limiting for External APIs (FIXED)
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/utils/rate-limiter.ts` (NEW)

**Problem:**
- No rate limiting on external marketplace API calls
- Risk of hitting API rate limits and getting blocked

**Solution:**
- Created token bucket rate limiter
- Pre-configured limiters for each marketplace
- Added `withRateLimit()` wrapper function for easy use

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { withRateLimit } from '@/lib/utils/rate-limiter';

const result = await withRateLimit('ebay', userId, async () => {
  return await ebayApi.getListings();
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

unset EBAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
npm run dev
# Should fail with clear error message
```

### 2. Queue Processor
```bash
# Test singleton pattern
# Call startQueueProcessor() twice
# Should log warning on second call
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker
```bash
# Simulate API failures
# Circuit should open after 5 failures
# Should reset after 1 minute
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make rapid API calls
# Should throttle to configured limits
```
