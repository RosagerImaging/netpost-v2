# Test Claude Integration

This is a test file to verify that our Claude Code GitHub integration is working correctly.

## Test Goals

1. ✅ Enhanced validation pipeline runs automatically
2. ⏳ Claude responds to @claude mentions in PRs
3. ⏳ Coverage reports are generated by Codecov
4. ⏳ Security analysis runs via CodeQL
5. ⏳ Dependabot manages dependencies

## Current TypeScript Errors to Fix

The validation pipeline has detected TypeScript errors in:
- Cross-listing components (`apps/web/src/`)
- Query function return types
- Error object typing inconsistencies

## Expected Claude Functionality

When I mention `@claude` in the PR for this branch, Claude should:
- Analyze the repository
- Review the changes
- Provide suggestions for fixing the TypeScript errors
- Potentially commit fixes automatically (if permissions allow)

Let's test this integration!
