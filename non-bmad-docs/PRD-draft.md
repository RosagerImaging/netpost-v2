AI-Native Reselling Assistant Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Goals and Background Context
Goals

Successfully launch a beta program within 3 months to acquire an initial cohort of 100+ active testers.

Achieve a 15% trial-to-paid conversion rate within the first 3 months of public launch, validating the business model.

Build a sustainable business by reaching 250 active "Pro" subscribers within the first year.

Deliver a superior user experience that achieves a 4.5+ star rating and a high CSAT score (>90%) for core feature reliability.

Drive adoption of the unique AI features, with a target of >60% of "Pro" subscribers actively using the AI Communication Assistant.

Background Context
Modern e-commerce resellers are hampered by inefficient, fragmented workflows across multiple platforms. The market is dominated by expensive solutions with complex, feature-gated pricing tiers. This project will create an AI-Native Reselling Assistant, built from the ground up to solve these core problems. By offering a seamless cross-platform experience (web and mobile), a simple and disruptive business model, and unique AI-powered tools, we will provide a smarter, faster, and more valuable solution for both hobbyist and professional resellers.

Customizable AI Automation: By default, AI features will act as on-demand assistants. However, a dedicated AI Settings area will allow power users to enable higher levels of automation.

Mobile-First Sourcing: The mobile app experience will be optimized for the "in-the-field" sourcing workflow.
