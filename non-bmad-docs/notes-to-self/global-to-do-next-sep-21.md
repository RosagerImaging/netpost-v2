#Global ToDo List / Next Steps

##First Priority:

**Vercel Build Errors:**
- Use /workflows:smart-fix to deploy sub-agents and get a working deployment on vercel. share build logs. specify double checking with playwright
  - `@debugger` has been used primarily so far, but try to specify `@devops-troubleshooter` as that was attempted prior to configuring for use
  
##Next Steps:

### ðŸ’¡ OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

* **Full Codebase Optimization:**
use `/workflows:performance-optimization` followed by `/workflows:full-review` (or maybe vice-versa... research) 

* **Create Automated Workflow for Next Phase:**
use `/workflows:workflow-automate` after using a planning command, agent, or planning mode (or combo) and test it out by reviewing entire codebase and creating tests where most important/valuable (integration tests, or research better option)

* **Performance Tuning:** (specific sub-agent for 1 and 3, perhaps the same as 2 or overlap. research)
   - Optimize E2E test execution time
   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets (specific sub-agent for this)
   - Add CDN for static assets

* **Enhanced Monitoring:** (specific sub-agent for these 3 tasks)
   - Add comprehensive error tracking
   - Implement performance monitoring dashboard
   - Create automated health checks
