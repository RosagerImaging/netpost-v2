ok, now please work through this list systematically as you see fit, acting as an orchestrator
  agent:
  1. please use whichever agent you think is most applicable to sort out and fix the remaining
  next.js configuration issue.
  2. please again use the appropriate agent to look over the code and highlight any blocks to a
  successful deployment on vercel that may have been revealed after resolving the html import
  error you fixed in step one.
  3. invoke the proper agent one more time to resolve any remainng errors that were uncovered in
  step 2.
  4. verify we have a successful deployment by using playwright mcp and the vercel mcp to actually
  view our web app up online available to the public.
